# Modeling exercises

## Value objects

Take a look at:
 
- [`convert.php`](convert.php), or
- [`quantities.php`](quantities.php)

These pieces of code are in need of proper *value objects*. Refactor the code, introduce objects and make sure that:

- Illegal states cannot be represented by these objects,
- Any domain knowledge you already have or have gained by reverse engineering the snippets will be documented in the tests and classes for these objects.
